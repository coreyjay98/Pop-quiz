# Corey's Pop Quiz #
For this task I was assigned with creating a short quiz based around developing and HTML. To create the quiz I had to combine HTML, CSS and Javascript to try and develop a fully functioning quiz that also stored and displayed high scores and allowed the user to take part in the quiz multiple times. 

## Javascript Struggles ## 
For me this was the hardest project yet and the one that consumed the most time for me, as of the date of uploading this project I have not yet completed it. The reasons I have for this mainly revolve around the Javascript elements of the page. I struggled to correctly use the local and session storage elements in Javascript to display the high scores that I successfully recorded, I believe this was because I did not know how to correctly push the values I got from the storage back to the high scores div. 

I also struggled with the timer function in the quiz, this was because the time function in Java is a whole new concept for me and so being able to set a timer correctly proved difficult for me.

After a tutoring session and much research on this project I still struggled to get the quiz working in any manner, that is why the code has a poor syntax and does not read well, I have commented on it to try and provide an easier read, but as I struggled in this task I have not been able to form a clear and consistent code in my Javascript file.

I am committed to improving this quiz page and will update the project every time I feel confident enough to make a change to it
